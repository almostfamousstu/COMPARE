# SKU Specification Comparator

A sleek, dark-mode-first Next.js 14 application that compares your SKU specification attributes with values generated by Google Gemini. Paste your attributes, run a comparison, and review mismatches instantly.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure your Gemini API key by copying the example env file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then update `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your Google Gemini API key.

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Google Gemini via `@google/generative-ai`

## Structured Output

The `/api/compare` route requests Gemini to return JSON that matches the exact attribute keys you provide. Only these keys are shared with Gemini and the response is validated against a generated JSON schema to ensure consistency.
